# Pong Game
This is a Python Turtle-based implementation of the classic arcade game Pong. It features two paddles, a ball that accelerates when it hits the paddle, and a scoreboard to keep track of the players' points.

# Requirements
To run this game, you need Python 3 and the Turtle module. You can install the Turtle module by running pip install turtle in your terminal.

# How to Play
The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle with the keyboard keys. The right player uses the Up and Down arrow keys, while the left player uses the W and S keys.

The objective of the game is to score more points than your opponent. You score a point by making the ball go past your opponent's paddle. The game ends when one player reaches 5 points.

# How to Run
To run the game, open a terminal window in the project directory and run the following command:

python main.py

The game window will open, and you can start playing by using the keyboard keys as described above.
